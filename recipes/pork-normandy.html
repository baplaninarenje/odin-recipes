    <h2>It's a family favorite and great for company</h2>
    <p>I got this pork Normandy recipe from my mother, who learned to make it when we lived in England.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large sweet apple - peeled, cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>5 ounces chicken stock</li>
        <li>4 fluid ounces hard apple cider</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Sear tenderloin in melted butter, then transfer to a
            plate.</li>
        <li>Add onions to the skillet; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in apple and cook until golden brown. Stir
            in flour and cook for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Whisk chicken stock and hard cider together in a bowl; pour into the skillet and bring to a boil while
            scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan. Return tenderloin to the skillet; season with
            salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet, transfer to the preheated oven, and bake until pork is slightly pink in the center, about
            45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63
            degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer tenderloin to a cutting board, and cut into 1 1/2-inch slices.</li>
        <li>Place onions, apples, and all liquid from the skillet into a blender or food processor; pulse until smooth.
            Return sauce to the pan, and reheat over medium-low. Stir in cream and heat until warm.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over sliced tenderloin to serve.</li>
    </ol>
